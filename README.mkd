# Binary Ninja Auto Utils
Auto Utils provides various helpers for automatically discovering features about a binary.

Some examples:

* Renaming of methods based on logging with method names
* That's it right now, sorry

## Examples

### Automatic symbol name discovery based on call args
In cases where you for example have a common logging function that will log the
caller's name using an argument passed to it, the plugin will be able to rename
the names of all callers based on the strings left in the binary.

Given an example binary with methods as shown below:

![Subroutines without clear or meaningful names](extras/discover_arg_before.png)

By running the "Analysis â†’ Discover caller names by call parameters" action
while being inside the `log_msg` subroutine and providing it with the parameter
name `arg1`, the plugin will change the name of all callers to `log_msg` as such:

![Subroutines after call-argument name discovery](extras/discover_arg_after.png)
